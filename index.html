        <p>At the young age of just twenty-four, singer/songwriter Taylor Swift has already made her mark on the world.<br> With four platinum records, several hit singles, and seven Grammy Awards, the young songwriter has been a<br> source of both entertainment and inspiration for people of all ages. Unlike other artists, Taylor Swift is <br>completely fearless with her songwriting.</p>
